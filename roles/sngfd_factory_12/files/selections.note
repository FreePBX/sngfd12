The "selections" file is generated from an already installed
FreePBX 17 system on Debian 12 using the command:

$ dpkg --get-selections > selections

The "selections" file in this directory is then processed
during ISO building to include required Debian packages
from the vanilla upstream Debian ISO. (This can help speed
up installations significantly.)
