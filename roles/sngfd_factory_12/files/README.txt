# HOWDY, WORLD!
# WELCOME TO SANGOMA FREEPBX!!
# DERIVED FROM DEBIAN GNU/LINUX!!!

Sangoma is providing this installer ISO to the community
as part of our commitment to open source projects, best
exemplified by our sponsorship and stewardship of both
Asterisk and FreePBX, making Sangoma the largest open
source telecommunications software company in the world.

Sangoma engineers developed this ISO to fulfill our own
needs to sell Asterisk and FreePBX based appliances, but
hopefully you find it useful for your purposes as well.

Please visit our website at https://Sangoma.com to learn
more about the company and know that your purchase of our
phones, hardware, appliances, and support helps us to keep
generating great software such as this installer.

# LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

If you downloaded this ISO from https://FreePBX.org
then you should know that Sangoma derives most of it from
stock vanilla Debian ISOs available at https://Debian.org
We stick in some shell scripts, spicy preseeds, and paint.
We also add our own Debian-compatible package repository
where we maintain special builds of Asterisk and FreePBX.

Special thanks to the Debian developers for having such
a fine ISO that we can build on!
